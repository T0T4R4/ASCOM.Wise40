    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p> This is an ASCOM ObservingConditions driver for the VantagePro weather station of the Wise40 instrument at the  Wise Observatory.
     We needed to write this driver since the actual station is hooked-up to a computer different from the one driving the 40" telescope.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>The VantagePro weather station has a serial port interface and is hooked-up to a serial port on the <i>weather-pc</i> computer in the main dome.
    The computer driving the dome (<i>dome-ctlr</i>) has no access to this port.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>The <i>WeatherLink</i> software, provided by the Davis Company and running on <i>weather-pc</i>, was configured to periodically (every 10 minutes) produce
    an HTML report that dumps the values for all its internal variables (using the Weather_Wise40_Vantage_Pro.htx template file).</p>
    <p>The report is produced in a local folder on <i>weather-pc</i>.</p>

    <p>This driver parses the HTML report file (mapped to a folder on <i>dome-ctlr</i>) and presents it as an ASCOM ObservationConditions object.</p>
    
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>The driver has an ASCOM compliant Setup window where the path to the HTML report file can be selected.</p>

    <h3>ASCOM Compliance</h3>
    <p>The driver passes the ASCOM 6.2 Compliance test.</p>
