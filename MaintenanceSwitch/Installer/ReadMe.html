    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p> This is an ASCOM SafetyMonitor driver for the main switch (at the back of the observatory's original console) in the 10 meter dome at the  Wise Observatory.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>The maintenance switch provides/denies power to all the relays that allow computer control of the 40" observatory.  Its main use
        is to prevent the computers from accidentally moving any of the observatory components (telescope, dome, dome shutter, etc.) while
        humans perform maintenance tasks.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>The driver monitors the switch's state and reports it as safe/not-safe via an ASCOM SafetyMonitor object.
    It can be used by other ASCOM drivers or by an Observatory-Controll class of software.</p>

    <h3>ASCOM Compliance</h3>
    <p>The driver passes the ASCOM 6.2 Compliance test.</p>
