    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This is an ASCOM SafetyMonitor driver for the Wise Observatory.
        It monitors the observatory's main SafetySwitch.
    </p>
    <p>The driver's <i>IsSafe</i> method should be called before any of the observatory's computer-controlled parts is controlled.</p>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>The Wise 40" Observatory has a main SafetySwitch at the back of the observatory's original console. 
    It enables/disables computer control of the various components (telescope, dome, focus, etc.).
    The main use of the switch is to prevent computer control while maintenance tasks are being performed at the observatory.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>
        If the driver's <i>IsSafe</i> method returns <code>false</code> the controlling method should throw an <code>InvalidOperationException</code>, as prescribed
        by the ASCOM standard for operations that cannot be performed at the moment.
    </p>

    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>The driver has no configurable parameters.</p>

    <h3>ASCOM Compliance</h3>
    <p>The driver passes the ASCOM 6.2 Compliance test.</p>
